# Rock, Paper, Scissors Detection using YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 with Tkinter

This project demonstrates how to detect Rock, Paper, and Scissors gestures using the YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models. The detection is integrated with a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI), enabling real-time interaction with the system. The system identifies the hand gesture and displays the corresponding result.

## Features
- Real-time gesture recognition for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
- Utilizes YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models for hand gesture detection.
- Tkinter GUI for real-time feedback.
- Supports both image and webcam inputs for gesture recognition.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Tkinter
- YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models
- other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

You can install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
